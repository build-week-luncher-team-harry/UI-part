Proposal

- What problem does your app solve? 
Finding donations for school lunches.
- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
 This app allows schools to broadcast the needs of their students by declaring an amount of donations that they would need to be fulfilled in order to provide lunches for those that go without.
- What is the mission statement? 
Our aim is to provide a meal for every child in need, no matter what the situation is!
Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
 There are many features required for this such as donations, errors, donors, schools, and etc.
- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
 Errors
- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
Frameworks - Libraries

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using? 
Semantic UI, React, Axios. 
- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?		
- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
 No. 

Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
  The target audience is people who are willing to donate to schools so that children can have lunch while at school.
- What feedback have you gotten from potential users? 
The feedback we’ve received is to make something where a monthly donation can be automatically recurring.
- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How? 
Yes we have. There are hundreds of  thousands of children who cannot afford to buy school lunch on a daily basis. This solution will help create a general fund that can be distributed among schools.

Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
